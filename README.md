# GPUIDrive

A file manager built with [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs) that I built in a day.

## Why?

I built this for the [Cap.so](https://cap.so?utm_source=gpuidrive) internal hackathon to learn more about [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs).

I really enjoyed building [Spacedrive](https://spacedrive.com) with [Tauri](https://tauri.app) but it's hard to make a webview feel as smooth as something native so I wanted to give it a try.

## But really why?

[gpui](https://www.gpui.rs) is fast and cool.

## Usage

```rs
cargo run -p gpuidrive --release
```
